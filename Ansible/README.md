Jasne! Oto przykładowe README dla podkatalogu `Ansible`, które możesz umieścić w tym katalogu:
# Ansible Automation

This directory contains various **Ansible playbooks** and **roles** designed for infrastructure automation. The playbooks and roles automate the setup, configuration, and management of different services and components across your infrastructure, such as PostgreSQL, Java, Docker, and more.

## Contents

* **Playbooks**: The main automation files for infrastructure setup and configuration.

  * `postgres_install.yml`: Installs and configures PostgreSQL on the target hosts.
  * `java_install.yml`: Installs and configures Java on the target hosts.
  * `system_checks.yml`: Performs system checks to ensure your environment is correctly configured.
  * `initial_setup.yml`: Sets up the basic infrastructure for new systems.

* **Roles**: Modular pieces of code that define reusable tasks for specific automation purposes.

  * **postgres_install**: Installs and configures PostgreSQL. Includes tasks for setting up the database, creating users, and configuring services.
  * **initial_setup**: Performs basic system setup, such as configuring the user environment, updating packages, and installing necessary dependencies.
  * **docker_setup**: Installs Docker and sets up containerization on the target hosts.
  * **java_install**: Installs Java and configures the environment.

* **Inventory**: The inventory file where you define your target hosts.

  * `hosts.yml`: List of target hosts for running the playbooks.

* **Variables**: Configuration files for storing variables used in playbooks and roles.

  * `postgresql_vars.yml`: Variables related to PostgreSQL installation and configuration.
  * `java_vars.yml`: Variables related to Java installation and configuration.

## Usage

To use these Ansible playbooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize the `hosts.yml` file to include the target hosts for your infrastructure.
3. Update the variable files to match your environment.
4. Run the playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbook_name.yml
```
